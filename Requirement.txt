The following Python libraries are needed:

TensorFlow/Keras:
Purpose: For creating, training, and evaluating the deep learning model.
Installation: Install using pip (or via Anaconda if using a virtual environment).
NumPy:
Purpose: For handling numerical computations and working with arrays.
Installation: pip install numpy.
Pandas:
Purpose: For handling CSV files (used for labels and metadata) and manipulating data in tabular format.
Installation: pip install pandas.
Matplotlib:
Purpose: For visualizing training progress (e.g., accuracy, loss curves).
Installation: pip install matplotlib.
OpenCV:
Purpose: For image processing and manipulation, such as resizing or augmenting images.
Installation: pip install opencv-python.
Scikit-learn (Optional):
Purpose: For additional evaluation metrics like confusion matrices, precision, recall, etc.
Installation: pip install scikit-learn.
H5py:
Purpose: For saving and loading models in .h5 format.
Installation: pip install h5py.

 Model Setup
Pre-Trained CNN Models:
Use models like ResNet50, VGG16, or MobileNet for transfer learning.
These models are pre-trained on large image datasets and can be fine-tuned for your specific task (age detection).
Fine-tuning:
Replace the final classification layer with one that fits your specific task (e.g., 3 categories for age groups like young, middle-aged, old).
Train the model using your dataset while keeping the pre-trained layers frozen.

Training the Model
Data Augmentation: Use ImageDataGenerator to apply transformations like rotation, zoom, flipping, etc., to the training data to improve model generalization.
Batch Size and Epochs:
Set a batch size (e.g., 32) and number of epochs (e.g., 6 or 10) based on your available computational power.
Callbacks: Use callbacks like ModelCheckpoint (to save the best model) and EarlyStopping (to stop training when the model performance plateaus).

Model Evaluation
Test Set: After training, evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset that wasn't used in training.
Metrics: Measure the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
