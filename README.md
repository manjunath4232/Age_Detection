# Age Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect the age group of a person based on an image. The model is trained on the UTK dataset and is evaluated based on accuracy.

## Features

- Fine-tuned pre-trained CNN model for age detection.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.

## Dataset

The model is trained using the **UTK Face Dataset**, which contains images of faces labeled with age groups: Young, Middle, and Old.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manjunath4232/Age_Detection.git

   
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
